### Matlab codes for processing protein denaturation curves

Use of these codes is described in Weinreb et al. (2023). They provide rudimentary data reduction and estimation of thermodynamic properties. They permitted modestly high throughput processing of thermal melting data from Thermafluor and CD melting curves for 16 variants of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase involving combinatorial mutagenesis of a key packing motif involved in catalysis and free energy transduction.
